Many people think it is not realistic to learn a programming language in 21 days. For example, Peter Norvig thinks it would take you `ten years`__\ . `How to Teach Yourself Programming`__\ , an Abstruse Goose comic, suggests that the only way is to build a time machine and then go back in time to day 21, replace the younger self.

You don't have to be so cruel to learn programming. 21 days does not have to be 21 days on the Earth. There are plenty of planets in the universe, so that you can find one planet, on which it is day 21 by the time you learn how to program. This is exactly the same reason why Perl 6 will be released by Christmas\ [#xmas]_\ .

    When Perl 6 arrives, every day will be like Christmas!
